modules
=======

Windows command-line utilities for getting all modules (managed/unmanaged dlls) being used by a particular process.

Use *modules* for the Win32 version (built with VS 2013) or *modulesinvoke* for the C# version (also built with VS 2013). *modulesinvoke* uses P/Invoke on the same Win32 functions that are used in modules.
